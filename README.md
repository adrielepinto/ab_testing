 The UX Designers team is working on a new sales page, with the objective of increasing the conversion rate from 13% to 15%, that is, a 2% increase in conversion for the product 'Bluetooth Keyboard'. The product has a retail price of $4,500.00. However, the manager would like to test the effectiveness of the new page on a smaller group of customers, in order to run less risk of dropping conversions, if the new page shows a smaller conversion than the old one.
 
# Challenge:

1. Is the conversion of the new page really better than the old one?
 
    The new page is 2.85% better than  old one.

 2. What potential sales figures can the new page bring?
 
 The new page can bring $25,803,000.00 of sales.

3. What is the total revenue from the sale of the new page's bluetooth keyboard?
   
  it will be $193,563,000.00
