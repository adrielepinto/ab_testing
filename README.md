 The UX Designers team is working on a new sales page, with the objective of increasing the conversion rate from 13% to 15%, that is, a 2% increase in conversion for the product 'Bluetooth Keyboard'. The product has a retail price of $4,500.00. However, the manager would like to test the effectiveness of the new page on a smaller group of customers, in order to run less risk of dropping conversions, if the new page shows a smaller conversion than the old one.
 
# Challenge:

1. Is the conversion of the new page really better than the old one?
 
    Wasn't impossible to see the effect on the new page

 2. What potential sales figures can the new page bring?
 
Wasn't impossible to see the effect on the new page


3. What is the total revenue from the sale of the new page's bluetooth keyboard?
   
  Wasn't impossible to see the effect on the new page

  However, was needed a sample of  4720 from the datase to run the teste.

A failed to reject the null hypothesis, that mean, the null hypothesis is true. Unfortunately with the sample size, it wasn't possible to conclude that the new page designer made by the UX Designers team IS or IS NOT better than the current page. It was impossible to identify an action with the data present in the dataset. The next step to improve the result of this test would be to collect more data that better explain the effect to take more samples.

However, in a hypothetical scenario, where the new page conversion actually went from 13% to 15%, the company would have a lift of $25,803,000.00 in the company's revenue.

Electronic House is a company that sells products online. The product director would like to develop a new way of filling out credit cards that isn't done manually. A solution was delivered where 90% of payments were filled in automatically. However, the design team would like to measure the effectiveness of the new product, to conclude whether the new payment method was really better than the old one.
  The two pages were put online by someone, and a label was assigned to each customer, showing which page the customer was viewing.

  # Challenge:
  
  What is the best payment method? Manual or automatic?
