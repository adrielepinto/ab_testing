 The UX Designers team is working on a new sales page, with the objective of increasing the conversion rate from 13% to 15%, that is, a 2% increase in conversion for the product 'Bluetooth Keyboard'. The product has a retail price of $4,500.00. However, the manager would like to test the effectiveness of the new page on a smaller group of customers, in order to run less risk of dropping conversions, if the new page shows a smaller conversion than the old one.
 
# Challenge:

1. Is the conversion of the new page really better than the old one?

2. What potential sales figures can the new page bring?

3. What is the total revenue from the sale of the new page's bluetooth keyboard?
